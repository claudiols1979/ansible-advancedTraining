upstream demo {
{% for server in groups.app %}

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://demo;
    }
}

upstream demo is just the name of the configuration block for nginx. 
this file is treated as any conf file for sites-avaiable therefor is linked to sites-enabled to serve data.

The jinja2 logic is refering to Ansible groups in inventory (app) which refers to the 2 hosts we have in the inventory
host1 = 192.168.0.193 
host2 = 192.168.0.194

jinja2 is a for loop, it will iterate over the 2 servers to serve data from both depending on workload and avaibility.
